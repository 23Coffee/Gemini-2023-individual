1. **Login** =  Each Astronomer, Science Observer, Supporter, Operation Staff, Telescope Operator, Developer, and Administrator can log in to the system multiple times.
2. **Create a science plan** = Astronomers can create a science plan, test the science plan via the virtual telescope and interactive observing mode, and submit the science plan to the system.
3. **Obtain control access to instruments** = Astronomers can obtain control access to instruments multiple times.
4. **Collect science data** = Astronomers can collect science data.
5. **Enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem** = The astronomer can enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem multiple times.
6. **Create an observing program** = After the use case “Create a science plan” is finished, the Science Observer can validate the science plan, transform the science plan to an observing program, and submit an observing program to the system. Then, the Operation staff can validate the submitted observing program.
7. **Execute the approved plan** = After the use case “Create an observing program” is completed, science observers can execute the approved plan multiple times, including monitoring the progress of the science plan execution and collecting astronomical data.
8. **Monitor the progress of science plan execution** = After the use case “Execute the approved plan” is finished, the Science Observer can monitor the progress of science plan execution multiple times.
9. **Review and adjust the program** = Science observers can review and adjust the program.
10. **Collect astronomical data** = After the use case “Execute the approved plan” is completed, Science observers can collect astronomical data, validate the integrity of collected data, and manage the collected data.
11. **Monitor general performance and system safety** = Telescope operators can monitor general performance and system safety multiple times.
12. **Enter telescope control commands from a remote site** = The Telescope operator can enter telescope control commands from a remote site anytime.
13. **Maintain the system, hardware, and software** = Supporters can maintain the system, hardware, and software multiple times.
14. **Maintain the installation of the subsystems** = Supporters can maintain the installation of the subsystems multiple times.
15. **Maintain the configuration changes** = Supporters can perform many times to maintain the configuration changes.
16. **Design, test, configure, and upgrade subsystems** = Developers can design, test, configure, and upgrade subsystems multiple times.
